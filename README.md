# Topometric Registration

Repository containing (experimental) code for testing topometric registration strategies for MapLite.

# Prerequisites

1. Download and install [Ceres Solver](http://ceres-solver.org/). Instructions can be found [here](http://ceres-solver.org/installation.html)

# Running the code

Currently, I've only added `synthesizeData.py`, which synthesizes road edge points and an OSM graph for a three-way intersection.
